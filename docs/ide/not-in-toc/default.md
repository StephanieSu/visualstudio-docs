# F1 help

It looks like you landed here by mistake. If you are looking for F1 help on a keyword or API name, be sure the cursor is positioned inside or just to the right of the word before pressing **F1**. If that still doesn't work, please try a search on https://docs.microsoft.com.

If you are searching for help on the text editor itself, see [Writing code in the editor](../../ide/writing-code-in-the-code-and-text-editor.md).
